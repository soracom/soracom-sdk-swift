# soracom-sdk-swift

An SDK for the Soracom API in Swift.

Current status: Still experimental and incomplete (as of 2016-04-10). This SDK is being factored out of a proof-of-concept iOS app, and that work is in progress.

The initial goal is to fully support current versions of iOS and (Mac) OS X.

A future goal, once Swift 3 is released, is to to build as [a Swift 3 package](https://swift.org/package-manager/#conceptual-overview), and to fully support Linux (and, hopefully, [other significant platforms?](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2016/04/07/google-facebook-uber-swift/)).
