/// The APIOperation class makes it easy to use Request instances with NSOperationQueue. The semantics are
/// similar to Request's `run(_:)` method. The normal way to use APIOperation is to take advantage of the
/// extension to NSOperationQueue that allows you to add a request directly to a queue:
///
///     let createOperator = Request.createOperator(emailAddress, password: password)
///
///     queue.addRequest(createOperator) { (response) in
///
///         // do something with response...
///     }
///
/// That will automatically create an APIOperation instance from the request, and add that operation to the
/// queue. However, you can also directly instantiate an APIOperation instance and add it to a queue:
///
///     let op = APIOperation(request) {  (response) in
///          
///         // do something with response...
///      }
///
/// The second more verbose form is mainly for if you are doing something more complicated with the 
/// operations themselves, like setting up dependencies between them.
///
/// FIXME: Mason 2016-05-07: on second thought, delete the NSOperationQueue extension and everything related to it.
/// It saves a tiny amount of typing, but it makes things harded to understand and the tradeoff isn't worth it,
/// expecially now that we have deferred-request-creating operations that can't use this stuff. Begone!
///
/// APIOperation is implemented as a synchronous operation, intended to be run on a background 
/// thread (normally by NSOperationQueue. You can manually `start()` one if you wish, but because
/// Request completion handlers call back to the main thread, you cannot start an APIOperation on
/// the main thread (it will deadlock). They must be started in a background thread.

This allows queuing operations which depend on data retrieved by previous operations, before any of the operations have actually executed.
