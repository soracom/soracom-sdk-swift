/// The APIOperation class makes it easy to use Request instances with NSOperationQueue. The semantics are
/// similar to Request's `run(_:)` method. There are two typical ways to use APIOperation. The simplest way
/// is to init an APIOperation with a Request instance, and then add the operation to a queue:
///
///     let op = APIOperation(request) {  (response) in
///          
///         // do something with response...
///      }
///     myQueue.addOperation(op);
///
/// However, in many cases, a request will depend on values returned from previous requests. For those cases,
/// you can initialize an APIOperation instance with a RequestBuilder, instead of a Request.
/// 
/// A RequestBuilder is a closure that returns a Request. However, the operation will not execute its
/// RequestBuilder closure, and thereby build the Request, until the operation itself is about to execute.
/// Assuming you use a queue whose `maxConcurrentOperationCount` property is set to `1`, 
/// this means that all previous operations in the queue will have finished before the Request is built.
/// That means you can do things like store a token fetched by a previous request, and then use the token when
/// subsequent operations create their Request objects.
///
/// For example, suppose we want to create an operation that makes a request to verify a token, but we don't
/// yet have the API token. Assuming a preceding operation in the queue will get that token and store it in 
/// the form of a SoracomCredentials object, then we could create an operation that will fetch and use the
/// token to build its own request, like this:
///
///        let builder: RequestBuilder = {
///
///            let creds = SoracomCredentials(withStorageIdentifier: myIdent)
///            return Request.verifyOperator(token: credentials.apiToken)
///        }
///
///        let handler: ResponseHandler = { (response) in
///
///         // do something with response...
///        }
///
///        let verifyOp = APIOperation(builder, completionHandler: handler)
///        queue.addOperation(verifyOp)
///
///
/// APIOperation is implemented as a synchronous operation, intended to be run on a background
/// thread (normally by NSOperationQueue). You can manually `start()` one if you wish, but because
/// Request completion handlers call back to the main thread, you cannot start an APIOperation on
/// the main thread (it will deadlock). They must be started in a background thread.

This allows queuing operations which depend on data retrieved by previous operations, before any of the operations have actually executed.
