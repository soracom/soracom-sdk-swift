    // Mason 2016-07-15: This was my first idea, but in Swift 2/3 there is a limitation of
    // the 'memberwise init' automatic initializer, whereby if you implement *any* custom
    // initializer, you no longer get the automatic memberwise one. This is terrible for our
    // use case here, because most of the Soracom API structures are just dumb structs, but
    // some have a huge number of fields (e.g. Subscriber), which make the memberwise init
    // really convenient.
    //
    // You can work around this by putting all the manual initializers in an extension for each
    // type, but that gets unwieldy so I am just going with a "to/from" pattern for now.
    //
    // The current limitations of Swift memberwise init are known, but not likely to be 
    // addressed soon:

    //
    // UPDATE 2017-07-18: FIXME: Revisit this decision, because Swift 4's awesome new Codable
    // adds a similar initializer via the Decodable protocol: init(from: Decoder)
    //
    // This has the same issues described above, but since we are definitely going to adopt
    // Codable for most or all model objects, the objection is moot. However, Payload itself
    // is due for refactoring/deletion, so I'm not worrying about this now.
