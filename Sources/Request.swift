/// The Request class defines and executes a single request to the Soracom API server. Typically, the API request is normally constructed via one of the convenience constructor methods, which takes an appropriate set of zero or more arguments, and the request is then executed with `run()`. The request executes asynchronously, and upon completion of the HTTP request, the `ResponseHandler` closure passed to `run()` is invoked to handle the server's response (or any error that occurred).
///
///
/// Example:
///
///        let req = Request.createOperator("foo@bar.baz", password: "bacon")
///        req.run { (response) in
///            if response != nil {
///                print("With regret, I must inform you an error occurred: \(response.error)")
///            } else {
///                print("Operator created.")
