/// The Request class defines and executes a single request to the Soracom API server. Typically, the API request is normally constructed via one of the convenience constructor methods, which takes an appropriate set of zero or more arguments. 
///
/// A Request instance may be executed with `run()`, or else wrapped in an APIOperation object and added to an NSOperationQueue for later execution. 
///
/// The request executes asynchronously, doing its network communication in an arbitrary background thread, and upon completion of the HTTP request, the `ResponseHandler` closure associated with the Request instance is invoked to handle the server's response (or any error that occurred). The response handler is executed on the main thread, for convenience, so things like updating UI may be done without additional work.
///
/// There are two ways to designate a response handler for a request. It's a read-write instance property, so you can simply set it, or supply it as a parameter when initializing a response. It is the last parameter of the various init and constructor methods, so that Swift's convenient trailing closure syntax may be used:
///
///
/// Example:
///
///        let req = Request.createOperator("foo@bar.baz", password: "bacon") { (response) in
///            if response != nil {
///                print("With regret, I must inform you an error occurred: \(response.error)")
///            } else {
///                print("Operator created.")
///            }
///        }
///        req.run()
///
/// ...or:
///
///        let req = Request.createOperator("foo@bar.baz", password: "bacon")
///        req.responseHandler = { (response) in
///            if response != nil {
///                print("With regret, I must inform you an error occurred: \(response.error)")
///            } else {
///                print("Operator created.")
///            }
///        }
///        req.run()
///
/// However, the response handler can also be supplied as an argument to the `run()` method, in which case it
/// takes precedence over any existing `responseHandler` instance property:
///
///     req.run { (response) in
///         // do something different
///     }
///
/// Request instances can be manually run, but often should be performed in a certain sequence, depending on the
/// results of previous requests. In such cases, it can be convenient to use APIOperation to sequentially 
/// execute requests from an NSOperationQueue.
