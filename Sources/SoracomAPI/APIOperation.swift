/// The APIOperation class makes it easy to use Request instances with NSOperationQueue. 
///
///
/// The simplest way is to init an APIOperation with a Request instance, and then add the operation to a queue:
///
///     let op = APIOperation(request)
///     myQueue.addOperation(op);
///
/// However, in many cases, a request will depend on values returned from previous requests. For those cases,
/// you can initialize an APIOperation instance with a RequestBuilder, instead of a Request.
/// 
/// A RequestBuilder is a closure that returns a Request. However, an APIOperation initialized this way won't
/// execute its RequestBuilder, and thereby build the Request, until the operation itself is about to execute.
/// Assuming you use a queue whose `maxConcurrentOperationCount` property is set to `1`, 
/// this means that all previous operations in the queue will have finished before the Request is built.
///
/// That means you can do things like store a token fetched by a previous request, and then use the token when
/// subsequent operations create their Request objects.
///
/// For example, suppose we want to create an operation that makes a request to verify a token, but we don't
/// yet have the API token. Assuming a preceding operation in the queue will get that token and store it in 
/// the form of a SoracomCredentials object, then we could create an operation that will fetch and use the
/// token to build its own request, like this:
///
///        let verifyOp = APIOperation() {
///
///            let creds = SoracomCredentials(withStorageIdentifier: myIdent)
///            
///            // creds doesn't yet exist when this operation is created and queued...
///
///            let req = Request.verifyOperator(token: credentials.token)
///
///            req.responseHandler = { (response) in
///
///                // do something with response...
///            }
///
///        queue.addOperation(verifyOp)
///
///
/// **Notes:** APIOperation is implemented as a synchronous operation, intended to be run on a background
/// thread (normally by NSOperationQueue). You can manually `start()` one if you wish, but because
/// Request handlers call back to the main thread, you cannot start an APIOperation on
/// the main thread (it will deadlock). They must be started in a background thread.

This allows queuing operations which depend on data retrieved by previous operations, before any of the operations have actually executed.
