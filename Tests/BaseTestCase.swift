    // Ideally, we would do this on the lldb command line in Xcode, but as of Xcode 7.3

    //
    //     ((lldb) p save_sandbox_root_credentials("foo", password: "bar")

    // It did used to work; seems like an Xcode bug. At any rate, the workaround is to uncomment 
    // the method call where it appears in the test case using it, and then change the parameters
    // to your real credentials instead of "foo" and "bar" or whatever.
    //
    // Then, re-run the test. After it runs once, be sure revert your changes immediately and not
    // accidentally commit your credemtials to your revision control history.
