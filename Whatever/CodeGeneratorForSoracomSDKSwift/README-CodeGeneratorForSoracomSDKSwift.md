# CodeGeneratorForSoracomSDKSwift
created: 2016-08-05

This tool:

- runs swagger-codegen to generate code that defines model objects and implements some functionality, based on the Soracom API spec
- post-processes that generated code to do whatever we need to do that is hard to do with swagger
- moves the code to its final location


This tool is for working on the SDK project itself (soracom-sdk-swift); it is not necessary to use this tool just to use the SDK.

To use this tool, you must have swagger-codegen installed (`brew install swagger-codegen`).
